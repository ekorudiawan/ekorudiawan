# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Eko Rudiawan Jamzuri

I am a **lecturer and researcher** at **Politeknik Negeri Batam**, specializing in **humanoid robotics**, **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning**. My work bridges academia and industry, focusing on developing intelligent robotic systems and advancing automation technologies.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Interests
- ðŸ¤– **Humanoid Robotics** â€“ Developing autonomous humanoid robots capable of complex tasks and interactions.
- ðŸ§  **Deep Learning for Automated Optical Inspection (AOI)** â€“ Implementing advanced algorithms for detecting product defects based on visual sensors in industrial environments.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)** â€“ Enhancing robots' abilities to interact with humans through visual and verbal communication.

## ðŸš€ Notable Projects
- **Barelang-FC Humanoid Robot:** A soccer-playing humanoid robot that has participated in international competitions, advancing real-time object detection capabilities.
- **Barelang-7 Humanoid Robot:** A dancing humanoid robot capable of interacting with humans through visual and verbal communication, showcased in international competitions.
- **PySolderInspect DL:** An Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) system for detecting Through-Hole Technology (THT) soldering defects on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), based on optimized deep learning algorithms.

## ðŸ’¡ Let's Collaborate!
I'm open to collaborations in **robotics**, **industrial automation**, or **AI for manufacturing**. Feel free to connect!
